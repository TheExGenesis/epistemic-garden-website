epistemic garden - mapping how ideas spread online
we're building tools to help communities understand their information landscape and protect against coordinated narratives and ai manipulation.
philosophy (2-3 paragraphs max)
online communities are rich sensemaking spots where people figure out truth together. but without awareness of the narrative patterns shaping discourse, they're vulnerable to psyops and manipulation that will only intensify with ai.
we follow a living lab philosophy - open by default, community-oriented. our volunteer data donors are the main stakeholders. we iterate with them to build "jungle eyes" - informed awareness of the memetic forces at play.
think of it as moving toward a germ theory for ideas. just as understanding microbes revolutionized public health, mapping idea diffusion can help communities maintain memetic sovereignty and epistemological robustness.
