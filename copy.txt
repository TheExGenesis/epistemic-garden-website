epistemic garden - mapping how ideas spread online
We're building tools to help communities understand their information landscape and protect against harmful coordinated narratives.

philosophy (2-3 paragraphs max)
Online communities are rich sensemaking spots where people figure out truth (useful frames) together. But without awareness of the narrative patterns shaping discourse, they're vulnerable to psyops and manipulation that will only intensify with AI growth.
We follow a living lab philosophy - open by default, community-oriented. Users who volunteer their data to the Community archive are our main stakeholders. We iterate with them to build "jungle eyes" - tools to inform awareness of the memetic forces at play.
We think of it as moving toward a germ theory for ideas. Just like building a microscope revolutionized public health, tools that map idea diffusion can help communities maintain memetic sovereignty and epistemological robustness.

core projects

community archive - crowdsourced social media data (17m tweets and growing)
keyword trends - like google trends but for your community's discourse
birdseye - visualize someone's body of work by topic over time
the nooscope - track idea origins and diffusion across the social graph (in progress)
meme reports - weekly synthesis of what ideas are spreading and where from (in progress)
discourse maps - navigate complex discussions and identify camps/arguments (in progress)
matchmaking - find friends, collaborators, trades, etc. (in progress)
